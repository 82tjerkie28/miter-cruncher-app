This document tracks feedback from users and potential future improvements.

### **Functionality & Precision**
*   **[Requested] Angle Snapping / Rounding**: Multiple users find specific angles (e.g., 32.45°) hard to set on standard saws.
    *   *Suggestion:* Option to snap to 10ths, whole numbers, or common angles.
*   **[Requested] Inside vs. Outside Measurements**: Confusion about whether length is measured from center, inside, or outside.
    *   *Suggestion:* Default to Outside (long edge), but allow toggle to Inside. Add a visual detail card showing all face lengths.
*   **[Requested] Type-in Input**: Ability to type exact angles/dimensions instead of just dragging.
*   **[Idea] Kerf Thickness**: Account for blade thickness (kerf) in cut lists to prevent panels ending up short.
*   **[Idea] Advanced Editing**: "Lock" points or segments to stretch shapes while maintaining angles (like SketchUp/CAD constraints).
*   **[Idea] Sprung Crown Moulding**: Support for bevel/miter calculations for crown moulding.

### **Platform & Education**
*   **[Idea] Educational / "Show Math"**: Toggle to show the underlying geometry formulas. Great for teaching skills in schools ("Fish vs. Fishing").
*   **[Idea] PWA / Offline Support**: Make it a Progressive Web App (PWA) so it can be installed and used offline in workshops without internet.
*   **[Idea] Self-Hosting**: Docker container support for users who want to host it themselves.

### **Visuals & UI**
*   **[Feedback] Detail Card**: When a piece is selected, show more details (Long face vs Short face lengths).
